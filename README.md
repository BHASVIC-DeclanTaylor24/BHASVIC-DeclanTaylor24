## Who Am I
I am someone who likes to work out problems and also i like to create programs that can help if its a simulator or a website. i am someone who will help people solve problems that they have. I am also interested in maths and economics.  

## Professional Goals
In the future i would like to become skilled data analysit or data scientist this is because i find using data and trying to make sense of it and then creating things out of that very interesting. Also in a team which will be able to innovate and create new things using programs.  

## Roles/Companies/Sectors I Am Interested In
Roles i would like to do are Data Analysit, Web Developer, Network Engineer  
Companies im interested in are any firms that deal with sports analytics for example opta sports, another company is American Express as there are many different jobs they have and you will be able to do many different things to do with computer science.  
Sectors that im interested in are Sports Analyist, Data Analyist, System Management.  

## What Am I Currently Working On
Currently i am working on my A level Coursework for computer Science. For the coursework i am creating a Simulator that will have a ball and a ramp and will show the effects when the conditions of both are changed im doing this because it links to maths A level very well which is also something i am interested in. I am using Java for this project as i think its a good language to use as many companies still use it.  

## Related Qualifications
GCSE Computer Science - Grade 6  
GCSE Maths - Grade 7  

## Soft Skills
Problem Solving - I am good and enjoy solving difficult problems and finding new ways to do things.  
Adaptability - I am able to change what i need to do to be able for a program to work if it doesnt work the first time or be able to change it if its not what others would like it to be and also be able to learn new ways to do things to make it easier and better.  
Teamwork - I like to work with other people to get things done as it allows more ideas to be used and if one person is stuck another will be able to help them i also work well in a team as i can communicate well with people.

https://github.com/BHASVIC-DeclanTaylor24/JDL-corporation  
This task was where we had to create a computer system for a hotel so they could check in and check out people and also make dinner reservations it was created in C.  What i learnt from that task was how you are able to get a few different different sets of code and then are able to conbined them together. Also it showed that you should create flowcharts and diagrams before starting this is because then you are able to see where you are at and it can make it much less confusing when you have to do a lot.  

https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/animalopoly-BHASVIC-DeclanTaylor24  
In this task we had to make our own version of monopoly using animals instead of houses. This was a group projects and in it i had to make the Animals, the Cards and the Dice. For this we used Java and we used OOP so that at the end we could get all of these classes and connect them all together. This taught me that it is good to create structure diagarams about your classes and also when you make your code it is good to write down what your doing and explain it all this is becuase when we start coding out coursework we would have to do this so it is just giving us practice on what we have to do.  

https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/DTJava  
In this Repository it is just different tasks about java coding and what it is. In this it showed how to use OOP and all the different parts of that such as incapuslation and inheritance. This taught me everything about java how to write it, how to use different classes and then connect them. It taught me how to use the fundimentals and then it built on that.  

https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/homework-BHASVIC-DeclanTaylor24  
In this repository it it many different bits of code that range from java to C. It is work that that is used so that i can refresh my memory on what it is and how to use it so that i dont use it for a long time and then i cant remember how to use it. This makes sure that i can as i have to do it often.
